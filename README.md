### Basic things

 - [Coding style](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) (the whole book is interesting but that chapter is essential to start working togeher).
- [Project folder structure](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-projects/): this is not set in stone and should be openly discussed and improved.
- [Project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).
- [Madrid Open Data Portal](https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/).

### Bibliography

#### Mixed interesting topics

- [Shared folder in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1M-lLxvZh1b_h3H4rWZg4nayPHAI7LD3Z): the idea is having all of our ~~pirated~~ books in a common place, easy to find and use. 

#### Online books and links

##### _About R_
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/): a nice introduction to the tidyverse and R in general by the man himself.
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/): you didn´t have enough? Here you go. More R. More Hadley.
